## Introduction:

**Hi there!** welcome to my blog  **"SkipToCode".**  In this blog we will learn about coding and related technologies together. you and me both of us will be learning together about programming from one subject to another.

You may wonder why this blog? There are so many blogs covering the same matter and what is the difference between this blog and others? well lets talk about that.

## Why SkipToCode?

Yes, there are is a large amount blogs which teaches programming this and that using some language. The problem i faced from these as a beginner is that they dive too deep into the subject without even realising that you are a beginner. They teach you the theory without actually teaching about how to use them.

Lets look at an example.

 if you are going to learn python and surfed the web for **what is python?** you may find some similar answer like below.

> "Python is an object-oriented, high-level programming language with integrated dynamic semantics primarily for web and app development. It is extremely attractive in the field of Rapid Application Development because it offers dynamic typing and dynamic binding options. " 

Reading the above lines creates an endless loop in my brain. This is not the way to teach programming to a beginner and it may even make them afraid to step into the subject. python can be easily defined as below without any technical jargon.

> "Python is a simple, easy to use programming language.You can use Python for developing desktop GUI applications, websites and web applications. "

See this is what beginners like us want to know before stepping into the complex world of Object Oriented Programming other stuffs. _**Every programming language is a tool for some purpose.**_ We want to learn about how to use a tool rather than hearing some complicated stuffs about it from start that make us want to quit it.

That's why this blog is made we will learn programming together. Believe me i'm also a beginner in this subject. We will learn programming together by skipping the theories that aren't needed now. There will be a new post in this blog every week about a topic i learned. we will understand everything code by code.

See you later!

let ans = num/2;
if (ans === 0)
{   
    document.write("number is even");
