**Hi guys!** we are going to skip right into modern Javascript. this tutorial may be splited into several parts based upon how much i can cover about each topic in Javascript.  

So lets jump right into the Javascript.

## Why Javascript?

You may wonder why to choose Javascript from several programming languages out there. Well for me it doesn't need an initial setup. All you need is a text editor and browser in your computer. It is the most trending programming language right now.

## Javascript:

Javascript is a scripting language used for creating web pages, web applications, games etc...

 (scripting language is a programming language that doesn't need any complicated setup.)

## Lets Skip In:

Open your preferred text/source-code editor there are plenty of them available right now. Some of the popular ones are are [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/ "Download VS Code") , [Atom](https://atom.io/ "Download Atom") , [Brackets](http://brackets.io/ "Download Brackets"). 

Create a new file with **.js  **extension (Example: **main.js**).

That's it we are ready to begin our journey.

## Variables and Conditional Statements:

**main.js**

```
let num = 200;
let ans = num/2;
if (ans === 0)
{   
    document.write("number is even");
} 
else
{
   document.write("number is odd");
}
```

You may wonder what is shown above. Just try to read it as it is and you may get a idea of what is going on. Yes, the above code is used to check whether a number is odd or even.

### Variables:

The words declared using **let** keyword are known as **variables** and they store values that are given after an equal (=) sign.

As you seen above variable can hold numbers, result of an arithmetic expression, strings and more.

> Strings  is anything written in between " " or ' ' in Javascript. In the above example  "number is even" is a string. 
>
> Numbers, strings are generally called as datatypes in Javascript. there are more datatypes in javascript than the ones mentioned here.
