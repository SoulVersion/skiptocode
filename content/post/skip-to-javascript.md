**Hi guys!** we are going to skip right into modern Javascript. this tutorial may be splited into several parts based upon how much i can cover about each topic in Javascript.  

So lets jump right into the Javascript.

## Why Javascript?

You may wonder why to choose Javascript from several programming languages out there. Well for me it doesn't need an initial setup. All you need is a text editor and browser in your computer. It is the most trending programming language right now.

## Javascript:

Javascript is a scripting language used for creating web pages, web applications, games etc...

 (scripting language is a programming language that doesn't need any complicated setup.)

## Lets Skip In:

Open your preferred text/source-code editor there are plenty of them available right now. Some of the popular ones are are [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/ "Download VS Code") , [Atom](https://atom.io/ "Download Atom") , [Brackets](http://brackets.io/ "Download Brackets"). 

Create a new file with **.js  **extension (Example: **main.js**).

That's it we are ready to begin our journey.

## Variables and Conditional Statements:

**main.js**

```javascript
  
```
{{< highlight javascript >}}
let num = 200;
let ans = num/2;
if (ans === 0)
{   
    document.write("number is even");
} 
{{< /highlight >}}
